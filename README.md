# Unity Tools for Visual Studio Code
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TobiahZ/unity-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TobiahZ/unity-tools)
## What this extension is

This is an **unofficial** extention created by Tobiah Zarlez, and is not affiliated in any way with Unity Technologies. 

The goal of this extention is to add miscellaneous functionality to Visual Studio Code for Unity developers

## What this extension isn't

This is not a comprehensive set of tools for Unity development, nor does it provide any debugging features.

If you want to debug your Unity projects, I would recommend getting [Unity's official debugger for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/vscode-unity-debug).

### Can you add XZY feature?

Possibly! Let me know, I'd love to hear your suggestions on what tools you'd like to see added to this collection.

## Feature list:

### Command: Open Documentation
Use the pallet command "Unity: Open Documentation" (`Cmd+'` on OSX or `Ctrl+'` on Windows and Linux) to open the Unity Documentation for the currently selected class.

### Command: Search Documentation
Use the pallet command "Unity: Search Documentation" (Shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+'` on OSX or `Ctrl+Shift+'` on Windows and Linux) where you can quickly enter whatever you want to search for.

### Command: Open VSCode Documentation
Added the pallet command "Unity: Open VSCode Documentation" to open the [Unity Development with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/runtimes/unity) page on the Visual Studio Code Documentation.

### Command: Get VSCode plug-in from the Asset Store
Added the pallet command "Unity: Get VSCode plug-in from the Asset Store" to open [dotBunny's Unity plug-in](https://github.com/dotBunny/VSCode/) on the [Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/jmM). Afterwards, will display a message with a link to the [How-To](https://github.com/dotBunny/VSCode/blob/master/HOWTO.pdf) and the Git repo for the project.

### Command: Get VSCode plug-in from the Asset Store
Added the pallet command "Unity: Generate Organizational Folders" to create some default organizational folders to your project's Assets Folder. The list of default folders are below: 
* Scenes 
* Scripts 
* Prefabs 
* Materials 
* Textures 
* Audio
